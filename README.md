# Latest-Project

Project Summary:
This project simulates how a global technology subscription platform (similar to Apple Music, iCloud or Microsoft XBox Game Pass) uses Data Science to understand customers, predict future behaviour and optimize marketing campaigns. The goal is to build an end-to-end pipeline that starts with raw customer data, transaction data and campaign data and transforms it into business insights and predictive models. Key tasks include to create analytical dataset in SQL, performing exploratory data analysis, predicting customer lifetime value (LTV) and churn using machine learing and survival analysis, measuring campaign effectiveness through A/B testing and causal inference, and optimizing budget allocation for maximum return on investment. The outputs include predictive models, optimization framework, interactive dashboards, and executive ready reports. This project demonstrates both technical expertise (Python, SQL, ML, pipelines) and business impact (ROI improvement, churn reduction).
